				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring is finally here! That means it’s time to start your back-to-school campaigns. Too early you say?  Not according to the content consumption trends we saw across the Outbrain network last year and spending trends from the National Retail Federation.</p>
<h2>Back-to-school content consumption starts as soon as the last bell rings</h2>
<p>Outbrain data shows that Americans began consuming content as early as June last year and according to the <a href="https://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;op=viewlive&amp;sp_id=1626" target="_blank">NRF’s Back-to-School Survey</a>, they began shopping in July.  Back-to-school and back-to-college spending was estimated at $72.5 billion, making it the second-biggest season for retailers. Winter holiday ranks first at $84 billion and Mother’s Day comes in at third at $21 billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BTS-Content-Consumption.png"><img class=" wp-image-13219 aligncenter" alt="BTS-Content-Consumption" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BTS-Content-Consumption.png" width="438" height="385" /></a></p>
<p>Why so early? These shoppers are likely taking advantage of fresh stocks of merchandise, early-bird markdowns and the freedom to comparison-shop.  Americans also spread out their content consumption (and spending) over a few periods of time instead of hitting it all at once at the end of the summer.  The second and more sustained spike in content consumption that began in August and lasted through September (a more traditional back-to-school shopping period) reinforces this trend.  The wave in September, after school has kicked off is also interesting to note; perhaps these  folks were looking for end-of the season and clearance items.</p>
<p>And don’t forget, in a world of “fast “ or “disposable” fashion, <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2012/08/22/some-teens-are-holding-off-back-school-clothing-purchases/s7qg8XosYpDTVPXZJWlJmK/story.html?camp=pm" target="_blank">back-to-school clothes shopping isn’t what it used to be</a>… especially for millennial girls.  The ritual of spending a Saturday in August at the mall with mom to buy school clothes is not the pinnacle of the shopping period.  Trend savvy teens and tweens are taking advantage of more affordable retail options and waiting to see what else comes out, and of course, what their friends are wearing.</p>
<h2>Back-to-school shopping content goes across devices</h2>
<p>According to the NRF, 37% of back-to-school shoppers conduct research and shop online.  In fact, they use mobile and tablets devices significantly to research products, compare prices, look up retailer information, redeem coupons and make purchases.</p>
<p>Across the Outbrain network, we saw fluctuations in school and college content consumption on desktop, mobile and tablets that reflects the varying motivations over these periods of time.  If the early, less rushed shoppers are doing research in June, then it makes sense that they consume back-to-school content at home on their desktops and tablets.  The more traditional and last-minute shoppers are likely consuming the content on the go and in-stores; this is seen by the growth in mobile and tablet consumption in August and September.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BTS-Content-Consumption-By-Device.png"><img class=" wp-image-13221 aligncenter" alt="BTS-Content-Consumption-By-Device" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BTS-Content-Consumption-By-Device.png" width="438" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What does this mean for your 2014 campaign?</h2>
<p>1. Ensure your back-to-school campaigns are live by June and increase the amplification at the beginning of August.</p>
<p>2. Keep your back-to-school and college campaigns live through September to reach those shoppers who don’t necessarily finish before school starts.  This gives you time to test and update your messaging.</p>
<p>3. Back-to-school shoppers spend their budgets on the things you’d expect: new clothing, shoes, school supplies and electronics. Why not use content-rich video and slideshows to tell the full product story!</p>
<p>4. Don’t under-estimate the power of reviews!  For those researchers and comparison shoppers, positive reviews of your products can be a deciding factor.  Drive to customer reviews to instill confidence in your offering.</p>
<p>5. Make sure your content meets the needs of a consumer on a tablet or mobile device &#8211;provide the right amount of information for each device…and optimize your site for purchases!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Wow, there’s a lot of ways to spend money online to help grow your business. Deciding which paid traffic sources to focus on can be pretty overwhelming. Focus is essential when optimizing your marketing mix, so we’ve identified 5 paid traffic source that you should master or at least test, before looking elsewhere.</p>
<h2>1. Google Adwords</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">This one’s a no-brainer. <a href="http://adwords.google.com/">AdWords</a> offers one of the most versatile paid traffic solutions around, both for search and display advertising. Targeting someone by what they search online is an excellent way of understanding a visitors intent to buy your product. Often referred to as reaching someone at the “bottom of the funnel”, Adwords can be extremely effective at targeting people who are ready to buy.  Unfortunately that portion of the funnel can be pretty small, so how you attract visitors at the top of the funnel and coax them down the funnel with great content and best practice inbound marketing tactics is the hard (or harder) part of marketing online. In the early days of the internet this might have been possible with the Google Display Network (GDN), but now due to banner blindness, for the most part we don’t really see these ads; and ya gotta see ‘em to click ‘em (you can quote me on that). Here&#8217;s a heat-map study from the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/">Nielson Norman Group</a> showing just how much people ignore display advertising.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a><img class=" wp-image-13225 aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" alt="Banner blindness heatmap" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/banner_blindness_image.png" width="592" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">That being said, a hugely effective tactic that the GDN can be used to execute, is retargeting. Coupled with some of the below paid traffic sources, retargeting is a great way of advertising only to people who have already shown interest in your company by visiting your website. And not your entire website, but a particular page on your website, like&#8230;I don’t know… your pricing or checkout page! (yeah, pretty good indicator of someone who’s thinking about pulling out their wallet)</p>
<h3>In short</h3>
<p><em>-If you know what keywords your customers are punching into Google, Adwords is a no-brainer.</em></p>
<p><em>-The GDN has massive reach, but think about retargeting before you drop a bunch of dough on people accidently clicking on your banner.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Facebook Ads</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Over the last couple of years, the<a href="http://www.facebook.com/advertising"> Facebook ad</a> platform has evolved a great deal. In it’s early days I was definitely a naysayer, but now it’s hard to find an online marketer worth their salt that doesn’t think Facebook offers extremely effective ways of driving targeted paid traffic. Not only can you choose the type of people you want to reach (gender, age, occupation, to name a few), but you can also target audiences that are similar to your existing customer base. That’s right, Facebook will actually find people similar to the ones who have already purchased your product. You can do all the demographic, geographic, contextual, or behavioral targeting you want, but I’d take the behavior of actually paying for your own product, over any of that, when it comes to finding your next customer.</p>
<p>In case you don’t believe me or think this sounds too complicated, here’s a super simple demo from that <a href="http://www.jonloomer.com/">Jon Loomer</a> on how to do it.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yP7l5f7BCqQ?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The downside of a constantly evolving platform is that you’ll need to keep up with the changes regularly via blogs and updates on their platform. I’ll actually go as far as to say that the key to success on Facebook is to stay connected to their updates. So seriously, stay up-to-date on their updates.</p>
<h3>In short</h3>
<p><em>-Get your Lookalike Audience on!</em></p>
<p><em>-And follow people like Jon Loomer like a hawk.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Outbrain Amplify</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">OK, obviously I’m extremely biased here, but you can’t dispute the facts. When a company outranks Google and Facebook for unique visitors on a comScore top 30 list, and you’re looking for paid traffic sources, I’m pretty sure you need to check it out.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a><img class="size-full wp-image-13226 aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" alt="comScore ranking - Outbrain, Google, Facebook" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/comscore_ranking.png" width="316" height="366" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">via <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2013/8/comScore_Media_Metrix_Ranks_Top_50_US_Web_Properties_for_July_2013">comScore Media Matrix study</a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Now, we definitely won’t take your ads like Facebook and Google, but there’s no question you’ll want to use us to drive traffic to those awesome blog posts, articles, videos, and third-party reviews… This is where you start the relationship with your potential customer, bringing them down the funnel by providing nothing but valuable, useful, funny, and endearing content.  Similar to Facebook and AdWords, Amplify offers a cost-per-click bidding system, the ability to test multiple headlines directed to the same content, device targeting, and geographic targeting. Our premium network of publishers ensure that your always getting traffic from high quality sources. More importantly though, the algorithms behind our content discovery platform are constantly working to find the most engaged audience for your content. The people who click our content recommendations are far more engaged than people who come from search or social, and we can prove! Here’s are a couple of the results you’ll find in our <a href="http://lp.outbrain.com/search-vs-social-report/">Discovery vs Search vs Social Audience Engagement Study</a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Izw4qSxbp2eQ6Q72F79iG7jse_hDmz9nVkRs_R6erjIsRohXCj88BshubaYIeOnD8u5BGvYi5enMfpH3zJ08n5BEav5ei6QA8-6aiVCAfk8uSiL8VdZuByI7RmKId2WwAg" width="563px;" height="588px;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">While Outbrain may be best for building that relationship with great content, many of our customers have seen great success using us to drive traffic to a recent press article or blog post, and then retargeting that person in Google’s Display Network or through Facebook’s Custom Audience retargeting. So in reality, social, search, and discovery actually work together quite nicely.</p>
<h3>In short</h3>
<p><em>-Outbrain outranks Google &amp; Facebook for monthly unique visitors, so when looking for paid traffic sources, we are a must!</em></p>
<p><em>-Use <strong><a href="https://my.outbrain.com/amplify/selfserve/create-campaign/?kme=fleiss%20paid%20traffic%20blog%20post">Outbrain Amplify</a></strong> to drive highly engaged traffic to your great content, then retarget those visitors on the GDN and Facebook.</em></p>
<p><em>-Bonus post about Outbrain&#8217;s impact on SEO: <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/blog/2012/06/how-to-distribute-your-content-at-scale-and-get-google-juice-now.html">How to Distribute Your Content at Scale and Get Google Juice Now</a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. LinkedIn Ads</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">For those of you in the B2B market,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/ads/"> LinkedIn Ads</a> could be a great paid traffic source. Their 3 main advertising options are sponsored updates, display and text ads, and InMail.  It’s hard for the B2B marketer not to be intrigued by a platform that allows you to target by job title and job functions. Other targeting options are location, age, gender, skills, company by name, industry, company size, school, and group. LinkedIn&#8217;s network is priced on a cost-per-click and it&#8217;s pretty expensive. You won&#8217;t find any targeting for less than $2 per click, and a lot of the targeting will start at $4.50.  For example this one:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a><img class="wp-image-13231 aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" alt="LinkedIn paid traffic campaign manager" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/linkedIn_campaign_screenshot.png" width="557" height="294" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">With their sponsored updates offering, you can not currently target people on only mobile or only desktop, and according their SVP of Product &amp; User Experience, Deep Nishar, this <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2014/04/18/the-next-three-billion/">year over 50% of their global audience will be mobile</a>. So make sure your mobile experience is great if you’re doing any sponsored posts. <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/linkedin-opens-ad-platform-157212">LinkedIn just announce the opening of their API to ad partners</a>, so definitely keep a close eye on what types of features their partners will be announcing.</p>
<h3>In short</h3>
<p><em>-It’s an expensive place to start with paid traffic.</em></p>
<p><em>-For the B2B marketer the targeting is almost impossible to ignore, but if your doing sponsored updates, make sure you have a great mobile experience for your visitors.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Twitter Ads</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Twitter has some pretty sweet targeting options. Probably one of the coolest ones is that you can target people who are tweeting about a particular television program. That’s probably not great for driving traffic though. You can also target by keyword, interests and followers, and even tailored audiences, similar to what Facebook is doing with their Custom Audience targeting. Their <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170771-tailored-audiences">“Tailored Audiences” support page</a> is definitely worth a read.  One of my favorite features of Twitter Ads is their lead card feature that allows you to collect someone’s email address without leaving twitter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a><img class="size-full wp-image-13227 aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid black;" alt="Twitter cards lead generation example" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/twitter_cards_image.png" width="411" height="349" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">All that said, twitter’s CPC is typically pretty expensive, and before you drop a ton of cash here, make sure your prospective customer spends time here. What does the organic traffic that comes from Twitter to your website currently do? If you’re already getting conversions, then definitely go for a test!</p>
<h3>In short</h3>
<p><em>-Great targeting options.</em></p>
<p><em>-But make sure this is where your audience hangs out.</em></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The customer journey is extremely varied, so remember that in reality a mix of all of these channels is probably the best way to bring potential customers down the funnel. As long as you understand the importance of building trust and providing value first without asking for anything in return, you will achieve results from these paid traffic sources. And don’t get too caught up in expecting people to go down the funnel the way you want them to. The funnel doesn’t actually look anything like a funnel. It looks more like this:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At our last Content Conversations Meetup in Singapore back in November 2013, we debated about whether content marketing was worth its hype. We decided collectively that it is real, powerful and here to stay.</p>
<p>Yet we see many brands today hesitate to embark on their own content marketing journeys. What’s stopping them? In a word – fear.</p>
<p>Lack of knowledge of how to create good content is the single biggest barrier to brands embarking on their own content marketing journeys. To tackle that challenge, we brought the industry together again for our 3<sup>rd</sup> Content Conversations Meetup in Singapore late last month, to discuss and dissect great content, and find out just what makes content discoverable, searchable and shareable.</p>
<p>Armed with a new ‘in the round’ format and a star-studded line up of some of the best content creation minds in the region, we packed the house with a record turnout of over 100 social media, marketing, start-up and public relations aficionados to tackle the content beast itself and find out how brands can create great content.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://site-20000-prod-ladc1.ladc1.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-SIng-pic1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13202" alt="Content Conversations SIngapore 1" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-SIng-pic1.png" width="556" height="229" /></a></p>
<p> With my co-host Don Anderson from Fleishman Hillard, we facilitated an enlightening, fast-paced, and sometimes controversial discussion that yielded some great insights from the likes of Click2View’s Neal Moore, BrandNewMedia’s Nick Fawbert, P&amp;G’s Omer Sher, Yahoo! Singapore’s Alan Soon and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://site-20000-prod-ladc1.ladc1.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-SInagpore-pic2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13203" alt="Content Conversations Singapore 2" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-SInagpore-pic2.png" width="654" height="435" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>©Copyright Outbrain 2014</i></p>
<p>Not limited to the on-site discussion, we also saw a fluid exchange of ideas via live Tweets from the audience, using the hashtag, #ContentConversations.</p>
<p>Here is a recap of some of my key takeaways from the night:</p>
<p><b>1.     </b><b>Good content is a great story</b></p>
<p>At our last event, we talked about how people love to tell and share stories, and the most compelling stories appeal to people the world over, regardless of geography, culture, age, gender or language. That is in a nutshell, what brands need to get to. Every brand has a great story to tell – they just need to find it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://site-20000-prod-ladc1.ladc1.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-Singapore-pic3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13204" alt="Content Conversations Singapore 3" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-Singapore-pic3.png" width="577" height="244" /></a></p>
<p> The challenge is finding honest stories that also resonate with the brand identity. It is not just about creating content that appeals to the consumer. It should also be built upon a brand’s goals and objectives. Alan Soon from Yahoo! Singapore shared the example of Bowen’s Big Mango publicity stunt. The ‘disappearing act’ certainly stirred up hype, but enraged consumers in the end when it turned out to be a stunt for a local fast food chain. Alan emphasised the need for an ‘elevated view’ on how to encourage brands to dig deeper into what that brand really stands for.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><i></i><b>2.     </b><b>Keep it real</b></p>
<p>Talking about cheated feelings. Following on the Bowen Big Mango example, the second insight that stood out for me was a lesson on authenticity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://site-20000-prod-ladc1.ladc1.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-SIngapore-pic5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13206" alt="Content Conversations Singapore 5" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-SIngapore-pic5.png" width="577" height="241" /></a></p>
<p>Alan questioned the extent of deception that some brands would go to in order to drive clicks to their content. Brands need to realize however, that content marketing can and will blow up in their faces if the content doesn’t deliver value, or if they try to camouflage sell tactics as content. So what if you succeed in driving eyeballs to your content. If it doesn’t deliver value, consumers will rebel. In a nutshell – don’t try to bullshit the audience.</p>
<p><b>3.     </b><b>Think differently about measurement</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, many marketers focus on clicks and thus fall into the deception trap because that is the only way they know how to measure success. The challenge to prove the business value of content is real, and this was something that Omer Sher from P&amp;G brought up. He explained that even before creating the content, brands have to determine the “business objective of content” to ensure that the marketing component of content marketing is realised at the end. He added that content must be viewed as part of the larger “content marketing ecosystem” and created with the business uplift factor in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://site-20000-prod-ladc1.ladc1.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC_Singapore-pic6.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13207" alt="Content Conversations Singapore 6" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC_Singapore-pic6.png" width="581" height="211" /></a></p>
<p>Content marketing requires investment, but how do you translate that into business outcomes?</p>
<p>The group discussed the need to switch the yardstick of success and to base success on the audience’s perception on content quality, instead of just the number of clicks. An alternative idea from Jim Ribbans at Fox International Channels, was to split one good piece of content and dedicate resources to developing more good content out of those separated pieces. At a lower cost and with a wider outreach to non-traditional platforms (e.g. websites, social media), these pieces of content can achieve both quality and audience reach. Of course, content quality needs to be prioritized over platform quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://site-20000-prod-ladc1.ladc1.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-Singapore-pic7.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13208" alt="Content Conversations Singapore 7" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-Singapore-pic7.png" width="566" height="236" /></a></p>
<p>Omer also talked about choosing the right agency partners because they can help you explain the business of content, and link it back to the business strategy, which leads me to my last point.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong><b>.     </b><b>Partner with the right people</b></p>
<p>There are multiple parties in the content marketing ecosystem. Who delivers the most value? What roles do they play? Kudos Content shared that journalists are no longer sole content creators and need to work with brands to finalise a piece of editorial content that is of value to both parties. At the same time, media or public relations agencies help mediate the two parties, whilst working to bridge the gap between creation and distribution. The whole content marketing process is now a giant amalgamated concept.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://site-20000-prod-ladc1.ladc1.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-Singapore-pic8.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13209" alt="Content Conversations Singapore 8" src="http://wp.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CC-Singapore-pic8.png" width="569" height="235" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The content creation process</strong></p>
<p>Content creation is a lot about collaboration and finding the right partnerships. The key to success is effective communication across all partners so everyone is on the same page and can rely on each other. Of course, this takes effort and calls on today’s content creators to invest quality time in their partners to guarantee a project’s success.</p>
<p>I personally find this new content creation process very interesting in the way it engages everyone, from creator to distributor to consumer. I attempted making sense of this huge “ecosystem” and my main takeaway is the need to jointly assess all the content assets with partners and work together to craft out a content creation process that suits your brand’s specific needs. But the job isn’t done once content is published. What is critical is to also put in place a process that allows brands to take signals and feedback from consumers’ interaction with the content, and feed it back into the content creation process. Content creation is never linear.</p>
<p>P.S. if you ever feel boxed in by the wealth of options (e.g. platforms, publishers, industry contacts, etc.) or face a ‘tyranny of choice’, keep calm and ask yourself Nick’s simple guiding questions:</p>
<p><b>5 Simple Questions to Get to the Content Marketing Strategy:</b></p>
<p><i></i><i>1.     </i><i>What are your goals and objectives?</i></p>
<p><i></i><i>2.     </i><i>Is your editorial strategy top-down (from supplier to consumer) or bottom-up?</i></p>
<p><i></i><i>3.     </i><i>What form or content do you want?</i></p>
<p><i></i><i>4.     </i><i>What distribution channels are you using?</i></p>
<p><i></i><i>5.     </i><i>How do you monetize this?</i></p>
<p>The biggest pitfall in content creation is to let the ‘tyranny of choice’ lead to a ‘paralysis of choice’ &#8211; where content creators cannot decide on one platform and therefore, take zero action.</p>
<p>To wrap it – this was certainly a night to remember, and I look forward to taking the conversation to the next level at our next Content Conversations, where we will be discussing content distribution. Stay tuned for more details to come. If you are not already part of the Meetup group, please sign up <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Content-Conversations/">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Outbrain, we sit at the nexus of content discovery and advertising. So, we’re more acutely intrigued by how the industry was depicted by <em>Mad Men</em> than most. We wondered, who else shares our fascination with the show?</p>
<p>Using our vault of data (we’re installed on over 100,000 publisher sites and serve over 150 billion recommendations each month), we put together this infographic that shows the states that are the most and least interested in the program and how it compares to the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Areas where advertising is central to the economy are more interested:</strong> New York, the advertising capital of America and, New Yorkers would argue, the world, is the most interested in stories about <em>Mad Me</em><em>n</em>. It’s followed closely by DC, which has a large number of advertising and communications firms and residents whose lack of morals dwarf those of Don Draper. With the exception of California and Illinois, all of the states in the top 10 are in the Northeast.</p>
<p><strong>Big Sky states care the least:</strong> Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota and Wyoming are the least interested in stories about <em>Mad Men.</em></p>
<p><strong>Americans are far more interested in stories about Mad Men than the Brits:</strong> Sterling Cooper may have won the Jaguar account and have had Lane Pryce as a partner, but it’s still very much an American show. Americans showed more interest in <em>Mad Men </em>stories, with a consumption rate 44% higher than that of Brits.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>We pulled the total number of page views in each country (U.S., U.K.), as well as within each state in the U.S., between March 1st and April 5th, 2014, to use as benchmarks against page views of the 1,339 stories published on Mad Men during this timeframe.We determined which pieces of content were related to Mad Men by the title and the publish date (Mar 1st – Apr 5th 2014).</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Content Conversations  – “Mobile engagement – the new opportunity in content marketing”</b></p>
<p>How do you create campaigns that work across the 14,000 mobile screen sizes that exist in the UK alone? How do you get return on investment in an apps, given that half of apps lose half their peak users within three months? How do you understand the role mobile plays in generating purchases?</p>
<p>Those are just a few of the questions to which the brand marketers packed into the Oxford Street head office of Outbrain were hoping to hear answers. They were not disappointed. A panel of experts answered all of those questions and more – they also raised a few more questions for delegates to ponder as they left.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blgo-kolaz.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-13109 aligncenter" alt="blgo-kolaz" src="http://www.outbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/blgo-kolaz.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Clear potential</b></p>
<p>Outbrain’s Head of Mobile, Rebecca Allen, and session chair, Alex Blyth, introduced the topic pointing to three statistics which highlight the importance of mobile to today’s marketers: for half the world&#8217;s Internet users the mobile is their primary tool for getting online; 37% of all digital media time is now spent on mobile devices;  and within the Outbrain universe click-through rates are higher for content accessed via mobile than via desktops.</p>
<p>The numbers are there, and the potential for engagement is clear. So, what can marketers do to take greater advantage of this opportunity? That is the question the following three speakers tackled.</p>
<p><b>Creating content</b></p>
<p>First up was Amy Nicholson, Head of Editorial Content Services at Sticky Content and someone who describes herself as a genuine content nerd. She offered some practical hands-on tips for what marketers can do to ensure their content performs well on mobile.</p>
<p>She urged the audience to consider the user journey – what are they doing when consuming mobile content? The easy assumption is that they are out of home, and indeed the daily commute is a primary time for mobile engagement, but 97%of consumers now say they access mobile content at home, more than any other location, so the easy assumption may not always be the right one.</p>
<p>In practical terms she advises giving copywriters small screen templates so they create content that works for mobile screens first time. Indeed her advice was to follow the COPE principle – ‘Create Once Publish Everywhere’ – so rather than generate significant quantities of mobile specific content she works with her clients to produce content that can be used across channels.</p>
<p><b>To fail to plan</b></p>
<p>“Marketing departments and agencies are packed full of planners, but for some reason when it comes to mobile planning goes right out of the window,” said Jon Hook, Head of Mobile at Mediacom. He advised delegates to map out their campaigns in advance, clearly understanding objectives, audiences, messages, creative, and the attribution model that will be used.</p>
<p>He argued that too few brands get this right. Too many suffer from fragmented mobile marketing supplier networks that are over-complicated and lack the necessary scale and transparency for a successful mobile campaign.</p>
<p>Hook went on to give the example of Sony Xperia Z1’s mobile campaign, as one that succeeded in getting all these factors right. It targeted mobile ads at iPhone owners who were within three months of contract expiry. Those who had seen it became twice as likely to consider the Z1 as their next phone.</p>
<p><b>Engagement on mobile is everything</b></p>
<p><b> </b>Alex Hewson Media Director at M&amp;C Saatchi Mobile pointed out the continued importance of the app: according to Flurry Analytics, across the UK and US apps make up 86% of mobile online activity with the mobile internet comprising the remaining 14%. This is actually up from 80% in 2013.</p>
<p>“Any idiot can drive a high volume of app downloads,” said. “The real challenge is to ensure those apps are used, and that the consumer engages with the brand. After all half of apps lose half of their peak users after just three months. They key is to plan carefully and to use the best technology partners across email, social, ads, SMS, and all the other ways consumers interact on their mobiles.”</p>
<p><b>Practical advice</b></p>
<p>Questions from the floor covered the potential of geo-location data with speakers urging attendees to investigate the possibilities there but to beware technology firms whose enthusiasm and promises go beyond their ability to deliver, the risks around data privacy, and the emerging technology solutions to help brands understand activity levels within apps.</p>
<p>There was also much conversation around the challenge of attribution. How to quantify the role mobile has played in the customer journey to purchase. The panel largely concluded that this remains an ongoing challenge for any site that lacks the sort of universal identifier that Google or Facebook enjoys.</p>
<p>In offering final piece of advice for attendees to take away and start using immediately, the panellists returned to this theme of understanding the relationship between the different elements of the marketing mix, as well as the need to avoid assumptions about why a user is on your app or mobile site, and finally keeping up to speed with new technology and whilst remaining careful not to fall blindly for the latest shiny innovation.</p>
<p>As delegates left the session, immediately reaching into bags and pockets to fish out their mobile phones, they reflected that mobile may no longer be the next big thing – it has finally arrived – but there is still a long way to go before it becomes a mature and fully understood channel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little more than a year ago, Yaron, Ori and a few more Outbrainers walked into the corner of the Associated Press newsroom that was the Visual Revenue office, to tell that team about Outbrain’s acquisition of the company.  It was exciting.</p>
<p>We announced it with the promise of an unmatched end-to-end solution for publishers to optimize content on all of their pages &#8212; across any channel, screen size or device &#8212; with both editorially-controlled and automated solutions.</p>
<p>Now we’re thrilled to announce a major integration of the two companies’ technologies. And we point to a mashup of their customer lists as proof positive of an initial fulfillment of that promise.</p>
<p>That is the newly enhanced Outbrain Engage.</p>
<p>Today, The Independent, Le Monde, Slate and ESPN are among a list of the world&#8217;s leading publishers that are enhancing audience engagement and monetization with our broader platform.  Outbrain Engage now gives publishers and their online editors unprecedented insight in to real-time user behavior and the performance of their content, plus tools and solutions to achieve business objectives.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s 5 key features:</p>
<p><strong>1. Instant Headline &amp; Image Testing – Real-time “A/B” testing of alternate headlines and images, helping editors decide which performs best.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Homepage position suggestions for editors to maximize story performance</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Real-time social engagement reports to learn which stories are being shared and which are actually generating audience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Performance-driven content recommendations that drive readers to read their next story (and the story after that).</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Site-wide predictive analytics to measure live performance of site placements against prior benchmarks.</strong></p>
<p>By adopting the enhanced Outbrain Engage, these and others are committed to apply a new level of scientific understanding and technology to support the craft of journalism and to content discovery.</p>
<p>We like to think this makes for a better, more optimized and personalized experience for every user. More importantly, though, it maintains – and enhances &#8212; the vital role of human editors and their judgment as the primary means to delight audiences.</p>
<p>And in the long run, that’s what both the audience and the publishers are after.</p>
